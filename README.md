# EmailWebScraper
This project is an web scraper that scrapes the web looking for email addresses starting from touro.edu (my college). The program finds all the links on a webpage and stores them in a Queue, and puts the email addresses in a Set to avoid duplicates. When finished with a given webpage, the program goes the the link in the Queue and so on, till we've collected 10,000 email addresses. At the end, the email addresses are then sent to a database. The whole program took only 6 minutes!
